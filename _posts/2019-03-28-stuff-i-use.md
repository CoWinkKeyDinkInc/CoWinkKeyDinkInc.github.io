Some people might want to know what software, services and hardware that I use,
so I am going to tell you them here.

## Hardware
  - Ryzen 5 2600X
  - ASUS B350 pro-vdh
  - Corsair mini-ITX cube case
  - power supply
  - dedotated wam

I also occasionally use a Raspberry Pi 3 from time to time. Last year I've actually
use this thing as a desktop computer for around 8 months.

## Operating system
I use the Kubuntu Linux distro, which is a free and open source operating system
that offers stability, relaliability, and consistency. Kubuntu is literally just
Ubuntu with the KDE desktop enviroment.

The Pi runs Raspbian.

## Email domain
I use Yandex for my email domain, and it's completely free with no strings attached.
They are basically the Google of Russia, so maybe there might be some strings
for some people. I don't really care that much.

## How is this website run?
This is a static website, so it doesn't offer dynamic stuff like comments, or
accounts, but that obviously isn't necessary. This static site is run using
GitHub Pages, which lets you host static websites for free. There are other places
that do this, like neo-cities. GitHub also lets you use Jekyll with it, which helps
in having to type less information.

## Domain name registrar
I use Namecheap, because they seem good. Also, if you have a student email, they
will give you a `.me` domain free for one year. A domain name is not that expensive,
usually $20 a year if the demand isn't high or it isn't a domain that has prices jacked
up like `.io`.

## Web browser
Just use Firefox.

## Video player
VLC is the only one worth using.

## Keyboard
I use the old Apple Aluminum wired keyboard with the numberpad. I don't hate Apple
because I got better things to do, like typing. One time I asked a fellow classmate
for help in fixing my WiFi router, to which he got quite annoyed once he found
out I was using an Airport Extreme. Imagine that, a Windows user making fun of people using
Apple products because they're propritary when they literally use proven spyware as their
operating system. Windows users have zero grounds to make fun of Apple users.

## Phone(s)
The LG V20 is pretty good, it has a second screen so you can see notifications when
the device is turned off. My first phone was the 1st Gen Moto E, which was a phone that
otherwise sucks, so I had to use LineageOS just so I can use the SD card and get
more than 4GB of storage. The battery life is better and it is smaller, so it is
good enoungh for watching videos on it.

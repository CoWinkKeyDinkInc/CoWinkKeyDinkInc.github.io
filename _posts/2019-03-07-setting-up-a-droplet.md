Ever wanted your own server that you can do whatever you want with it? Too lazy
or got parents too nosey to let a computer run 24/7 in your own house? That's
excatly where Virtual Private Servers (VPS) comes in! A VPS is a virtualized
server that is hosted by somebody else over the internet. You can setup anything
you want on there and host some websites, or an email server, or a Minecraft
server, or maybe all three at the same time on a single VPS!

There are various services that offer this, like Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Google Cloud Hosting, Microsoft Azure, and other various small hosting companies.
I would suggest Digital Ocean, because the interface is simple for beginners, and
 if you got a student email, you get a $50 credit on Digital Ocean to spend it
on a VPS, which starts at the minimum of $5 a month, so that's actually quite a
bit of free money for once (The minimum is actually worth using too btw). I'm
going to put [thewebzone.net][1] on there as soon as I get the real basics of
[thewebzone.net][1] up and running.

Interacting with the server is vastly different from interacting with your
desktop, because to save on resources most servers don't use a graphical user
interface, so when setting up and configuring a server, you will have to use the
terminal to interact with it. Luckily I actually know how to use a terminal
so that isn't really a big problem for me.

## HERE IS HOW TO DISPLAY AN IMAGE USING MARKDOWN WITH JEKYLL, THE STATIC SITE GENERATOR
You may have noticed that when you try to link an image from anywhere other than `index.md`
that it just seems impossible to link an image directly.
Turns out complicated syntax was our problem the entire time! :O
In two steps, you will learn how to properly link an image so it will display correctly on
your site. This, of course, assumes you store all your static files such as images, PDFs, etc
in an `assets` folder on the root directory.

1. Follow this example {% raw %} `![a young man with an afro]({{site.url}}/assets/issme.jpg)` {% endraw %}
2. That's literally it

Thank you for your time :)

The Trotsky is one of those movies that you see that has an interesting premise,
but then you watch the movie and notice it does not go much more into exploring
its own initial concept.

# The Plot
It stars Jay Baruchel, who is mostly known as that guy from Tropic Thunder that
looks like that other guy from Ghost-busters. He plays a teenager named
Leon Bronstien, a Anglophone in Montreal who believes he is the reincarnation
of [Leon Trotsky][1], a Russian revolutionary who worked side by side with
Lenin until Stalin kicked him out and got some Spanish guy to brutally murder
him with an ice pick in Mexico. That's gonna hurt. After starting a strike at
his dad's workplace, he forces him to go to, uh oh! **PUBLIC SCHOOL.** And he
has to convince all these **public** kids that they should rise up against the
administration and form a real student union to represent the interests of the
students. He has to help free **public** kids from their apathy and turn to
direct action. **IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL.**

To be fair, this is a public Anglophone school, and as a guy who went to a
Catholic school, public schools are probably the scariest place on the planet.
One time this girl felt bad for me when I told her I went to a Catholic school,
but to be fair it's nothing like it is in the movies. The girls just wore
whatever they wanted! Only one of my teachers became a nun, and I didn't even
get to see the Pope at my graduation, which was very disappointing. I was
thinking about asking him why don't we just call a crusade against pedophiles
or something. Or why he tries to be humble when he literally lives in his own
cute sovereign state with its own secret library nobody can read the books from.
There's probably proof of aliens, a 367 year old Neapolitan pizza recipe, and a
VHS copy of a car safety video I've been trying to look for many years.

# Underlying features
Notice how I lost focus back there? That reminds me that this movie has lost
focus. They don't really do much to explore the wacky concept. I mean it's not
even deep with any communist themes so you're just left with not much to think
about. In fact, we don't even know if he's serious or not at the end. He's a
little nervous every time he speaks, but the world pulls a bunch of things
around him such as meeting his love interest when she is 7 years older than him,
just like the real Leon Trotsky. Are they coincidences or not? The movie says who
cares! Whatever, maybe this relationship might be interesting, since it's an
older woman right? Nah, it just gives up on that too, which is pretty lame since
it was something not often explored about in movies. She just hates him from how
annoying he is and then falls in love with him because of how annoying he is.
But all of these sort of movies are like that, so what was I expecting anyway.

I mean the most edgiest thing in the movie was when he drops a truth bomb about
how priests abused all those Newfoundlanders, and how stupid and useless the
government and the Catholic Church were in stopping it.

Also for some reason [Ben Mulruney][2] makes a short appearance in this movie
despite the fact that he's just some guy that's on a stupid show called eTalk,
but to be fair, the movie makes fun of eTalk a few times so it balances it out.
I never even watched eTalk. There was also this guy called Dwight that everyone
hated, which was probably the funniest thing in this movie despite how simple it
is.

The other characters are kinda flat and just feel like props into his fantasy
that we still don't know if it's a fantasy or not. But you can tell the movie
is distinctly Canadian, right down to the colour style that has to emulate
the colour style that other down-to-earth British films and television has used.
Not a lot of spoken French in a movie taking place in Montreal, I know it's on
"the Anglophone" side, but come on.

While it had let me down by a lot, the move is still passable at what it does.
If you're looking for another 2000s era high school comedy movie, this is the
movie for you. I give this movie a **5/10**

**OH WAIT A MINUTE.** It turns out that there is no subtitles included on the
DVD at all! No subtitles on a movie *literally released 10 years ago,* ladies
and gentlemen. I mean whoever made these DVDs were aware of the communist themes
right? It's about removing all oppression in the world, which this movie does
not by making deaf and hard of hearing audiences unable to watch the movie. It
has twice the irony because there isn't even French subtitles either. Maybe it
is on the Blu-Ray copy, but I got the DVD one since that was what they had at my
library. The DVD is ablest, so I'm sorry guys, but this movie is instantly
disqualified and gets an automatic **0/10**.

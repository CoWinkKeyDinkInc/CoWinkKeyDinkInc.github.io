Welcome to patrickrogers.me, the personal site of Patrick Rogers.
I plan on making a new website soon, that may perhaps be *revolutionary*.
Not exactly innovative or new, but it will be cool. This site will just show
the various ways that you can contact me, and updates on how the *revolutionary*
site works, and whatever else I have to say. It's a nice site, I might make the
interface nicer soon.

## How did you make this site?
Basically, if you're a student, you can create an account on
[namecheap.com](namecheap.com) and use your school email and get a `.me`
domain free for one year. So I took it. After that it's only $20 a year, which
is not bad. Then I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which lets you
host static webpages for free. And you can use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
with it so you don't have to copy and paste the nav bar 20000 times in your
HTML files! It's truely incredible.

## What else?
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
 - Laptop
 - Ubuntu Linux
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

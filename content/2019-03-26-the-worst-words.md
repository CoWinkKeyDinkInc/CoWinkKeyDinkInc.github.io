There are some words that should never be used because they're bad. Let's talk
about bad words, and why they are bad, in no particular order.

## Titular
A word that means relating to, or existing in name only,
like the phrase *de joure.* Literally nobody on the planet has ever spoken this
word.
## Anthropomorphic
An absolute snobby way to say "human-like". Completely different from
personification though.
## Colloquial
This is literally the bourgeois term for *everyday language.*
Nobody uses this in normal speech, is it supposed to be ironic?
Why not just say *informal speech?*
## Latinx
There is no reason to ever use this term unless the person in question does not
see them-self as either male or female. But wait, *Latino* is also used when
referring to a group of men or people. Why not just use that since it is often
used as a gender-neutral pronoun? One time I read an article that said this
woman was the *first latinx female congresswoman* or something. If I can recall, I
think it literally said she is a woman even before saying Latinx. Could've saved
all that writing by just saying **FIRST LATINA.**
## SIN number
Social Insurance Number Number
## Miscellaneous
I am unable to spell this right. Now that I've actually bothered reading the word
for the first time ever, I can say I am a bit embarrassed.

I've had this article as a draft for three months and I can't think of anything
else so if you know just message me or something lol.
